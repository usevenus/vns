## Venus - Object-Oriented Standard Library for Perl 5

Venus is an object-orientation framework and extendible standard library for
Perl 5 with classes which wrap most native [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) data
types. Venus has a simple modular architecture, robust library of classes and
methods, supports pure-Perl autoboxing, advanced exception handling, "true" and
"false" keywords, package introspection, command-line options parsing, and
more.

## Features

- Perl 5.18.0+
- Zero Dependencies
- Fast Object-Orientation
- Robust Standard Library
- Intuitive Value Classes
- Pure Perl Autoboxing
- Convenient Utility Classes
- Simple Package Reflection
- Flexible Exception Handling
- Composable Standards
- Pluggable (no monkeypatching)
- Proxyable Methods
- Type Assertions
- Type Coercions
- Value Casting
- Boolean Values
- Complete Documentation
- Complete Test Coverage

## Aspirations

The following features and goals should anchor the direction and development of
this project:

- No dependencies
- Performance-minded
- Exception handling
- Pure-Perl autoboxing
- Pluggable standard library
- Consistent naming, intuitive behaviors
- Robust and accurate documentation
- Small, flexible, powerful, optional
- Simple package reflection
- Utility classes for common behaviors
- Value classes for primitives data types
- Composable standards via traits (roles)

## Contributing

We rely on your contributions and feedback to improve Venus, and we love
hearing about your experiences and what we can improve upon. All contributions
are always welcome! See the [contributing

## Philosophy

The main goal of Venus is to act as a standard library, i.e. to provide a
robust set of methods for dealing with common computing tasks when operating on
primitive data types. Venus is concerned about developer ergonomics much more
than speed or conciseness.
